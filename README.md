## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Retired Full-Stack Developer | Hobbyist Coder | Tech Enthusiast:
After 35 years as a full-time full-stack developer, I'm now retired and enjoying the freedom to dive into hobby projects that spark my curiosity.

### Tech Background:
Most recent years focused on C# development.
Earlier experience with VB.NET, non-.NET BASIC, Pascal, C, and C++.
Strong interest in technical and industrial solutions, with additional experience in business-oriented systems.

### Database Experience:
Solid hands-on work with MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and earlier versions of Oracle.

### Education & Origins:
Some university-level programming courses (Fortran, Simula, Oracle).
First inspired by programming in high school around 1974.
These days, I code for fun, explore new tools, and occasionally share projects that reflect my lifelong passion for software development.
